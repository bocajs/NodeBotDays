<h1>Espruino instructions</h1>

Espruino is Javascript truly on the Arduino device.<BR>
You can also program it from an [online IDE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/espruino-web-ide/bleoifhkdalbjfbobjackfdifdneehpo) available on the Chrome browser (even on the chromebooks)

Now Espruino has their OWN line of boards. These boards are a little more expensive than the ESP8266 we have in our Node Bot Days but they come with support and easy to upgrade firmware.

But for us I've created scripts here on this directory where you'll find a script for windows (flash.bat) and a script for Mac/Linux (flash.sh) to slash the ESPRUINO firmware into your existing ESP8266 devices.
