# Notes on Johnny-Five Directory

Here you'll find 4+ example johnny-five scripts:
- blink.js - the Johnny-five Blink.js setup for the USB Firmware (see notes in the file for details on your OS or if you want to use WIFI)
- esp8266Pins.js - This is a handy include so you don't have to think which pins match which which Johnny-Five pins (the ESP8266 is different than your standard Arudino in the Pin Assignment)
- FiveMultipleLED.js - Same as the blink, but a little prettier
- proximity.js - To use the proximity sensors (we have 5-6 around) with johnny five.

You MUST start with the official [Johnny-Five Example Page](http://johnny-five.io/examples/)


OTHER things you'll find here:
- ESP8266 FIRMWARE Directory - this is where you'll find the two types of firmware to get your device BACK (if you tried espruino) to the Johnny-Five Firmware. There's the Standard and WIFI firmwares.
- Directories for EACH OS (Win, Mac, Linux) which will have drivers and node_modules for those that have problems. You probably don't need any of this. but it's here just in case
