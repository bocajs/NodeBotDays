# Linux files

NO! You DO NOT need to use these files. But on ONE ubuntu laptop I had (a VERY old 8 year old chromebook converted to ubuntu) I NEEDED the node_modules from this directory.

HOW did I build it. NO there wasn't something special to setup like I did in windows. I simply created the node_modules directory in a NEWER Ubuntu laptop and copied it over.

THIS is what you see here. 

SO ONLY use this directory if you get an error with "Missing serialport dependency"

Otherwise you CAN follow the advice of simply running "npm i" in the main directory and you'll have eveyrthing working.
