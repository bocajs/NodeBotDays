Some newer Macs need drivers (believe or or not) for all of the ESP 8266 devices
Because of these were are including a driver found from this repo. \

I know. No one wants to install a driver, but I did work on my computer.

You WILL be asked to go into the settings and accept this driver from an "unknown author" because it's NOT for the apple App Store.
